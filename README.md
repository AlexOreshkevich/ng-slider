ng-slider
=====================

Angular directive slider control.

Welcome to a fork from awesome job of Egor Khmelev https://github.com/egorkhmelev/jslider

Why
-------------

Original implementation provides very nice features but too much for my needs, this one is simplifyed.

Source files were divided in several files, and not angular integrated.

It takes me time to make it works and all jquery code is included in directive, I do not know if it is the best thing to do today ;)

Demo

Installation
------------

Using npm:

```
npm install ng-slider
```

How to use it
-------------

You should already have script required for Angular, note sanitize module use.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular-sanitize.min.js"></script>
```

to the list above, you should add:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="ng-slider.min.css">
```

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="ng-slider.min.js"></script>
```

Then, inject `ngSlider` in your application module:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngSlider']);
```

and then just add an `div` with `tweets` directive name attribute, `hashtag` scope variable attribute.

```html
<div tweets hashtag="hashtag" button="true" count="15" refresh="60"/>
```

'hashtag' is your default hashtag search value.

```javascript
$scope.hashtag = 'football';
```

### Attribute

* `hashtag`: scope hashtag string variable object, default 'football'
* `button`: show refresh button, default true
* `hash`: show refresh button, default true
* `refresh`: scope variable, refresh time

Example with all above features:

```html
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="ctrl">
	<div tweets hashtag="hashtag" hash="true" button="true" count="5" refresh="10"/>		
</div>
```

### Build

You can run the tests by running

```
npm install
```
or
```
npm test
```

assuming you already have `grunt` installed, otherwise you also need to do:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```
